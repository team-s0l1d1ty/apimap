name: BOLA template for challenge 1 

description: |- 
              Endpoint /identity/api/v2/vehicle/{uuid}/location allows us to check out vehicle's location.
              This endpoint requires Authorization, but we might be able to view another user's vehicle information if we have their UUID
              The following will test the endpoint for the resultant BOLA vulnerability found by:
                  checking for status_code as it was observed that status_code 200 is the code for successful query.
                  text pattern "vehicleid" and "latitude" is used as these strings are found when request is successful 
              In the sample, we are only using 2 uuid and 3 request. 
              First without token to test if we need authorization token, second with token to establish the a happy flow and last the BOLA vulenrability
