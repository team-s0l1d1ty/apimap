name: template for bypassing Sign Up Password Complexity

description: |- 
              Endpoint /identity/api/auth/signup only checks for length of password but not complexity. 
              We found out that password complexity checking is only done on frontend. 
              As such we were able to bypass the frontend complexity check by signing up with the API directly.

requests:
  - url: http://localhost:8888/identity/api/auth/signup
    method: POST
    json:
      name: pentester
      email: pentester@example.com
      number: 990099009900
      password: 123456
    response_checks:
      - status_code: 200

          - pattern: User registered successfully! Please Login.
